5		For reference, I'm an avid watcher of women's sports (tennis and soccer) and generally believe these sports don't get the attention they deserve. My twitter algorithm (which is messed up and very not customised) would show me lots of videos of Caitlin Clark and Sabrina Ionescu, which led me to believe the WNBA was actually doing quite well. I've also been to a couple of women's college games, and I thought they were doing well lol, but I guess I wouldn't know any better.   Today, a colleague mentioned that the quality of the WNBA in general is quite poor, and that    (1) Lots of basic mistakes e.g. layups are fumbled quite often   (2) The WNBA has not been selling as a product, and demand for tickets is low. My colleague mentioned that the NBA and NBA players contribute a decent amount of money to the WNBA to keep it afloat.    (3) Caitlin Clark would likely not stick around in the WNBA for much longer.   So I have a couple of questions   (1) Is the quality of the WNBA actually subpar?   (2) Are there other more popular women's basketball leagues, and are they more popular because the quality is better?   (3) Is the WNBA actually struggling to stay afloat financially, and is that because of the quality of matches?  Thanks everyone, and sorry if I did this wrong.

11		We present iBall, a basketball video-watching system that leverages gaze-moderated embedded visualizations to facilitate game understanding and engagement of casual fans. Video broadcasting and online video platforms make watching basketball games increasingly accessible. Yet, for new or casual fans, watching basketball videos is often confusing due to their limited basketball knowledge and the lack of accessible, on-demand information to resolve their confusion. To assist casual fans in watching basketball videos, we compared the game-watching behaviors of casual and die-hard fans in a formative study and developed iBall based on the fndings. iBall embeds visualizations into basketball videos using a computer vision pipeline, and automatically adapts the visualizations based on the game context and users' gaze, helping casual fans appreciate basketball games without being overwhelmed. We confrmed the usefulness, usability, and engagement of iBall in a study with 16 casual fans, and further collected feedback from 8 die-hard fans.

12		This paper presents a method to assess a basketball player's performance from his/her first-person video. A key challenge lies in the fact that the evaluation metric is highly subjective and specific to a particular evaluator. We leverage the first-person camera to address this challenge. The spatiotemporal visual semantics provided by a first-person view allows us to reason about the camera wearer's actions while he/she is participating in an unscripted basketball game. Our method takes a player's first-person video and provides a player's performance measure that is specific to an evaluator's preference.   To achieve this goal, we first use a convolutional LSTM network to detect atomic basketball events from first-person videos. Our network's ability to zoom-in to the salient regions addresses the issue of a severe camera wearer's head movement in first-person videos. The detected atomic events are then passed through the Gaussian mixtures to construct a highly non-linear visual spatiotemporal basketball assessment feature. Finally, we use this feature to learn a basketball assessment model from pairs of labeled first-person basketball videos, for which a basketball expert indicates, which of the two players is better.   We demonstrate that despite not knowing the basketball evaluator's criterion, our model learns to accurately assess the players in real-world games. Furthermore, our model can also discover basketball events that contribute positively and negatively to a player's performance.		Gedas Bertasius|Hyun Soo Park|Stella X. Yu|Jianbo Shi		
13		The underlying physics of basketball shooting seems to be a straightforward example of the Newtonian mechanics that can easily be traced by numerical methods. However, a human basketball player does not make use of all the possible basketball trajectories. Instead, a basketball player will build up a database of successful shots and select the trajectory that has the greatest tolerance to small variations of the real world. We simulate the basketball player's shooting training as a Monte Carlo sequence to build optimal shooting strategies, such as the launch speed and angle of the basketball, and whether to take a direct shot or a bank shot, as a function of the player's court positions and height. The phase space volume that belongs to the successful launch velocities generated by Monte Carlo simulations are then used as the criterion to optimize a shooting strategy that incorporates not only mechanical, but human factors as well.

14		Recent deep learning-based object detection approaches have led to significant progress in multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. The current MOT methods mainly focus on pedestrian or vehicle scenes, but basketball sports scenes are usually accompanied by three or more object occlusion problems with similar appearances and high-intensity complex motions, which we call complex multi-object occlusion (CMOO). Here, we propose an online and robust MOT approach, named Basketball-SORT, which focuses on the CMOO problems in basketball videos. To overcome the CMOO problem, instead of using the intersection-over-union-based (IoU-based) approach, we use the trajectories of neighboring frames based on the projected positions of the players. Our method designs the basketball game restriction (BGR) and reacquiring Long-Lost IDs (RLLI) based on the characteristics of basketball scenes, and we also solve the occlusion problem based on the player trajectories and appearance features. Experimental results show that our method achieves a Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) score of 63.48$\%$ on the basketball fixed video dataset and outperforms other recent popular approaches. Overall, our approach solved the CMOO problem more effectively than recent MOT algorithms.		Qingrui Hu|Atom Scott|Calvin Yeung|Keisuke Fujii		
15		This paper proposes a gravity balanced arm exoskeleton design for basketball shooting training. The potential energy equation of the mechanism is derived. A simulation of the arm going through the basketball shooting motion is done on the mechanism. Throughout the motion the total potential energy is constant. Thus, the proposed arm exoskeleton is indeed gravity balanced with the use of two springs.		Yunfei Liu|Zhanghao Yang		
16		For professional basketball, finding valuable and suitable players is the key to building a winning team. To deal with such challenges, basketball managers, scouts and coaches are increasingly turning to analytics. Objective evaluation of players and teams has always been the top goal of basketball analytics. Typical statistical analytics mainly focuses on the box score and has developed various metrics. In spite of the more and more advanced methods, metrics built upon box score statistics provide limited information about how players interact with each other. Two players with similar box scores may deliver distinct team plays. Thus professional basketball scouts have to watch real games to evaluate players. Live scouting is effective, but suffers from inefficiency and subjectivity. In this paper, we go beyond the static box score and model basketball games as dynamic networks. The proposed Continuous-time Stochastic Block Model clusters the players according to their playing style and performance. The model provides cluster-specific estimates of the effectiveness of players at scoring, rebounding, stealing, etc, and also captures player interaction patterns within and between clusters. By clustering similar players together, the model can help basketball scouts to narrow down the search space. Moreover, the model is able to reveal the subtle differences in the offensive strategies of different teams. An application to NBA basketball games illustrates the performance of the model.

17		"In this study we focus on the prediction of basketball games in the Euroleague competition using machine learning modelling. The prediction is a binary classification problem, predicting whether a match finishes 1 (home win) or 2 (away win). Data is collected from the Euroleague's official website for the seasons 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, i.e. in the new format era. Features are extracted from matches' data and off-the-shelf supervised machine learning techniques are applied. We calibrate and validate our models. We find that simple machine learning models give accuracy not greater than 67% on the test set, worse than some sophisticated benchmark models. Additionally, the importance of this study lies in the ""wisdom of the basketball crowd"" and we demonstrate how the predicting power of a collective group of basketball enthusiasts can outperform machine learning models discussed in this study. We argue why the accuracy level of this group of ""experts"" should be set as the benchmark for future studies in the prediction of (European) basketball games using machine learning."

18		The development of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has benefited from the emergency of a variety type of game environments where new challenging problems are proposed and new algorithms can be tested safely and quickly, such as Board games, RTS, FPS, and MOBA games. However, many existing environments lack complexity and flexibility and assume the actions are synchronously executed in multi-agent settings, which become less valuable. We introduce the Fever Basketball game, a novel reinforcement learning environment where agents are trained to play basketball game. It is a complex and challenging environment that supports multiple characters, multiple positions, and both the single-agent and multi-agent player control modes. In addition, to better simulate real-world basketball games, the execution time of actions differs among players, which makes Fever Basketball a novel asynchronized environment. We evaluate commonly used multi-agent algorithms of both independent learners and joint-action learners in three game scenarios with varying difficulties, and heuristically propose two baseline methods to diminish the extra non-stationarity brought by asynchronism in Fever Basketball Benchmarks. Besides, we propose an integrated curricula training (ICT) framework to better handle Fever Basketball problems, which includes several game-rule based cascading curricula learners and a coordination curricula switcher focusing on enhancing coordination within the team. The results show that the game remains challenging and can be used as a benchmark environment for studies like long-time horizon, sparse rewards, credit assignment, and non-stationarity, etc. in multi-agent settings.

19		We present a model that uses a single first-person image to generate an egocentric basketball motion sequence in the form of a 12D camera configuration trajectory, which encodes a player's 3D location and 3D head orientation throughout the sequence. To do this, we first introduce a future convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts an initial sequence of 12D camera configurations, aiming to capture how real players move during a one-on-one basketball game. We also introduce a goal verifier network, which is trained to verify that a given camera configuration is consistent with the final goals of real one-on-one basketball players. Next, we propose an inverse synthesis procedure to synthesize a refined sequence of 12D camera configurations that (1) sufficiently matches the initial configurations predicted by the future CNN, while (2) maximizing the output of the goal verifier network. Finally, by following the trajectory resulting from the refined camera configuration sequence, we obtain the complete 12D motion sequence.   Our model generates realistic basketball motion sequences that capture the goals of real players, outperforming standard deep learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

20		In professional basketball, the accurate prediction of scoring opportunities based on strategic decision-making is crucial for spatial and player evaluations. However, traditional models often face challenges in accounting for the complexities of off-ball movements, which are essential for comprehensive performance evaluations. In this study, we propose two mathematical models to predict off-ball scoring opportunities in basketball, considering pass-to-score and dribble-to-score sequences: the Ball Movement for Off-ball Scoring (BMOS) and the Ball Intercept and Movement for Off-ball Scoring (BIMOS) models. The BMOS model adapts principles from the Off-Ball Scoring Opportunities (OBSO) model, originally designed for soccer, to basketball, whereas the BIMOS model also incorporates the likelihood of interception during ball movements. We evaluated these models using player tracking data from 630 NBA games in the 2015-2016 regular season, demonstrating that the BIMOS model outperforms the BMOS model in terms of team scoring prediction accuracy, while also highlighting its potential for further development. Overall, the BIMOS model provides valuable insights for tactical analysis and player evaluation in basketball.		Rikako Kono|Keisuke Fujii

I played my sisters. They played at The University of Missouri and I was still a young kid. They had me playing on the scout team and they had a few WNBA players on their team like, Sophie Cunningham and a couple others. I was in the 7th or 8th grade going crazy. So, I have real life experience. It's just a difference and I wish this would stop being a conversation because it should be common sense. I appreciate common sense. I feel sometimes that's lost a little bit.”  Via Ball in the family podcast with Lonzo & Gelo Ball  I do think NBA players in 8th grade like MPJ who was always a top ranked prospect all his grade school days would still be able to compete especially since he always had the size on him too. Maybe inexperience would have gotten him but I don't think he would have gotten absolutely cooked.	generic	Eastern_Courage_7080	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/1p1lnlg/michael_porter_jr_says_he_wants_people_to_stop/	1763590492.0

5	Should i cut this player off?	Me and some guys usually book one private run a week as some of us dont like going to a local gym but still enjoy hooping.      one of the guys that comes on the other team had basically missed every shot the entire session, and had a run where he smoked like 3 wide open layups all back to back. he picked up the chair, and threw it where our bags where. He also often will throw his teammates under the bus, telling them to lock in despite him not contributing much. He doesn't cut, he doesn't set screens often, and he often gives up 3s because he doesn't step up on screens.   and after his behavior , i just kind of view him differently. Im the one that organizes the run and sends the invite for the session and hes usually a regular but he has a poor attitude and him bursting out like that was not the first time. the previous time he smashed the cushion on the wall out of anger.     we try to coach him up a bit and tell him that if he did other things on the court him missing his shots isnt as detrimental because hes at least a positive in other ways.      i feel bad because ive known him since highschool and although we arent friends off the court hes a decent guy. 	generic	Open_Bake_8013	https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/1p1o33b/should_i_cut_this_player_off/	1763596577.0

11	Learning to Ball: Composing Policies for Long-Horizon Basketball Moves	Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills. A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states. Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.	generic	Pei Xu|Zhen Wu|Ruocheng Wang|Vishnu Sarukkai|Kayvon Fatahalian|Ioannis Karamouzas|Victor Zordan|C.

12	The problem of shot selection in basketball	"In basketball, every time the offense produces a shot opportunity the player with the ball must decide whether the shot is worth taking. In this paper, I explore the question of when a team should shoot and when they should pass up the shot by considering a simple theoretical model of the shot selection process, in which the quality of shot opportunities generated by the offense is assumed to fall randomly within a uniform distribution. I derive an answer to the question ""how likely must the shot be to go in before the player should take it?"", and show that this ""lower cutoff"" for shot quality $f$ depends crucially on the number $n$ of shot opportunities remaining (say, before the shot clock expires), with larger $n$ demanding that only higher-quality shots should be taken. The function $f(n)$ is also derived in the presence of a finite turnover rate and used to predict the shooting rate of an optimal-shooting team as a function of time. This prediction is compared to observed shooting rates from the National Basketball Association (NBA), and the comparison suggests that NBA players tend to wait too long before shooting and undervalue the probability of committing a turnover."	generic	Brian Skinner	http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.5793v2	2011-07-28T19:01:58Z
13	Filtering Procedures for Sensor Data in Basketball	Big Data Analytics help team sports' managers in their decisions by processing a number of different kind of data. With the advent of Information Technologies, collecting, processing and storing big amounts of sport data in different form became possible. A problem that often arises when using sport data regards the need for automatic data cleaning procedures. In this paper we develop a data cleaning procedure for basketball which is based on players' trajectories. Starting from a data matrix that tracks the movements of the players on the court at different moments in the game, we propose an algorithm to automatically drop inactive moments making use of available sensor data. The algorithm also divides the game into sorted actions and labels them as offensive or defensive. The algorithm's parameters are validated using proper robustness checks.	generic	Rodolfo Metulini	http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10412v1	2018-06-27T11:20:31Z

16	Improving Algorithms for Fantasy Basketball	"Fantasy basketball has a rich underlying mathematical structure which makes optimal drafting strategy unclear. A central issue for category leagues is how to aggregate a player's statistics from all categories into a single number representing general value. It is shown that under a simplified model of fantasy basketball, a novel metric dubbed the ""G-score"" is appropriate for this purpose. The traditional metric used by analysts, ""Z-score"", is a special case of the G-score under the condition that future player performances are known exactly. The distinction between Z-score and G-score is particularly meaningful for head-to-head formats, because there is a large degree of uncertainty in player performance from one week to another. Simulated fantasy basketball seasons with head-to-head scoring provide evidence that G-scores do in fact outperform Z-scores in that context."	generic	Zach Rosenof	http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02188v5	2023-07-05T10:27:46Z
17	The price of anarchy in basketball	"Optimizing the performance of a basketball offense may be viewed as a network problem, wherein each play represents a ""pathway"" through which the ball and players may move from origin (the in-bounds pass) to goal (the basket). Effective field goal percentages from the resulting shot attempts can be used to characterize the efficiency of each pathway. Inspired by recent discussions of the ""price of anarchy"" in traffic networks, this paper makes a formal analogy between a basketball offense and a simplified traffic network. The analysis suggests that there may be a significant difference between taking the highest-percentage shot each time down the court and playing the most efficient possible game. There may also be an analogue of Braess's Paradox in basketball, such that removing a key player from a team can result in the improvement of the team's offensive efficiency."	generic	Brian Skinner	http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.1801v4	2009-08-12T21:37:23Z

Furthermore, our model can also discover basketball events that contribute positively and negatively to a player's performance.	generic	Gedas Bertasius|Hyun Soo Park|Stella X.

20	Basketball-SORT: An Association Method for Complex Multi-object Occlusion Problems in Basketball Multi-object Tracking	Recent deep learning-based object detection approaches have led to significant progress in multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. The current MOT methods mainly focus on pedestrian or vehicle scenes, but basketball sports scenes are usually accompanied by three or more object occlusion problems with similar appearances and high-intensity complex motions, which we call complex multi-object occlusion (CMOO). Here, we propose an online and robust MOT approach, named Basketball-SORT, which focuses on the CMOO problems in basketball videos. To overcome the CMOO problem, instead of using the intersection-over-union-based (IoU-based) approach, we use the trajectories of neighboring frames based on the projected positions of the players. Our method designs the basketball game restriction (BGR) and reacquiring Long-Lost IDs (RLLI) based on the characteristics of basketball scenes, and we also solve the occlusion problem based on the player trajectories and appearance features. Experimental results show that our method achieves a Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) score of 63.48$\%$ on the basketball fixed video dataset and outperforms other recent popular approaches. Overall, our approach solved the CMOO problem more effectively than recent MOT algorithms.	generic	Qingrui Hu|Atom Scott|Calvin Yeung|Keisuke Fujii	http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19655v1	2024-06-28T04:49:57Z
