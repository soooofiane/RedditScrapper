1	We are not doctors, we are not physio therapists.  Don't take your medical advice from Random People on the Internet.   We don't know why your knee hurts, or how to rehab a wrist sprain, or some other injury..... Go get it looked and get your advice from a professional.	reddit
2	This thread for all questions on what shoes should i buy? What ball should i buy? Which hoop is best? How do I build an outdoor court? What knee brace is best? and all other clothing or gear or equipment questions.  Link to old thread. .  https://www.reddit.com/r/Basketball/comments/1f2wl91/official_basketball_shoes_and_gear_thread/	reddit
3	Sometimes the defender can anticipate my moves and the position of the ball, reaching in quickly to steal it. It’s hard for me to protect the ball in those situations.	reddit
4	For reference, I'm an avid watcher of women's sports (tennis and soccer) and generally believe these sports don't get the attention they deserve. My twitter algorithm (which is messed up and very not customised) would show me lots of videos of Caitlin Clark and Sabrina Ionescu, which led me to believe the WNBA was actually doing quite well. I've also been to a couple of women's college games, and I thought they were doing well lol, but I guess I wouldn't know any better.   Today, a colleague mentioned that the quality of the WNBA in general is quite poor, and that    (1) Lots of basic mistakes e.g. layups are fumbled quite often   (2) The WNBA has not been selling as a product, and demand for tickets is low. My colleague mentioned that the NBA and NBA players contribute a decent amount of money to the WNBA to keep it afloat.    (3) Caitlin Clark would likely not stick around in the WNBA for much longer.   So I have a couple of questions   (1) Is the quality of the WNBA actually subpar?   (2) Are there other more popular women's basketball leagues, and are they more popular because the quality is better?   (3) Is the WNBA actually struggling to stay afloat financially, and is that because of the quality of matches?  Thanks everyone, and sorry if I did this wrong. It's my first time posting here	reddit
5	I want to become a slasher, but i cant find a practice routine to follow. Its also hard to practice slashing solo because there is no defense. If someone can give me a couple drills to do or just a direction to go, that would be very appreciated.	reddit
6	I have varsity tryouts coming up this week but the coach has already told all the players that will be on the team this year who made it without seeing everyone play. I know I’m better than a decent amount of players on the team but it sucks that I don’t even have a chance to make the team	reddit
7	Only the Miami heats home court seems to have this. All other courts are currently very plain and clean looking. Why was the reasoning for the removal ?	reddit
8	In my opinion there shouldn’t even be a debate, Jordan is by far the best of all time. It’s not close. Eye test, actual stats and analytics. He wins them all.   He beats LeBron in every single analytic in both the regular season and playoffs. VORP per 82, BPM, WS/48, Raptor, PER, OWS, DWS….oh and he has more championships, MVP’s, Finals MVP’s, scoring titles, all defensive first terms, etc.   I can’t believe people actually try debating this. 	reddit
