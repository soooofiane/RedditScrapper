3	Obviously works here, 70+ in a row. Klays shot is known to be picture perfect. But I’ve been taught for the off hand to stay parallel to the ball, and in this video he moves his palm facing forward. Any reason for this and does it help? 	reddit
4	I know I sound completely delusional based off the title, which is why im making this post.      I got cut from my high school team 2 years in a row, and never tried out after. By my senior year, I found that I was on the same level, maybe a step below, the kids on my varsity team. This is without taking the sport seriously.   Looking back I completely regret not taking hoops seriously, because I know if I did, I could easily make the team and possibly start. Im now a freshman at arguably one of the best d2 schools in the country, and my delusions are getting the best of me, so I just want a more educated opinion:  Im not expecting consistent minutes, or even minutes at all. Im wondering if I trained the sport like my life depended on it for the next couple years, if I could maybe get a last roster spot by my junior or senior year.   I've been studying the teams defensive and offensive systems daily, and getting to know everything I can about the coach and the way they play. I've also been getting around 200 shots up a day, playing pick up daily, trying to put on more weight in the weight room, and working heavy on my fundamentals (schools getting busy rn, will do even more volume on breaks/summer).   This is just the beginning. ideally I'll be working like this for a couple years, because I know the levels to this game and frankly I got a long way to go. but im willing to outwork everyone else  My question is, If I train like my life depended on it for a couple years, ideally make my school's the club team to get organized experience and hopefully dominate, is it possible that maybe I could fill a role and earn a last man roster spot by my junior or senior year? Again im not even looking for minutes, I would just want to contribute to the team in anyway I can and be apart of a team.     Am I crazy? please tell me if I am, this thought has just been constantly on my mind for some reason, and I feel like I would totally regret it in the future if I don't at least try.     	reddit
5	Hello! I'm going to preface this by saying I live in the UK know nothing about basketball: but my mate's son is really getting into it and I want to encourage him by getting him a nice ball for christmas. I don't mind spending a bit of money if it's good. Also not sure what size? Any help appreciated! 	reddit
6	Lately, I’ve been thinking about how different it feels playing for an AAU team compared to a school team. I’ve done both, and honestly, they each have their own vibe.  AAU ball is super competitive. It's like everyone’s there to prove something. The games are faster, the travel is more intense, and you’re up against players from all over, not just your district. It’s great for exposure if you’re serious about playing at the next level, but it can get expensive and time-consuming pretty fast.  School basketball, on the other hand, feels more about community. You’re playing with people you see every day, representing your school colors, and the crowd actually knows you. There’s something special about hearing your classmates cheer when you hit a three or make a big play. It might not always be as flashy as AAU, but it hits differently.  One thing that’s the same in both  you end up living in your jersey. Between practices, tournaments, and late-night games, that thing becomes part of your identity.  I recently saw a team order custom sleeveless sets with heat-printed butterfly mesh fabric and V-necks, the kind of lightweight stuff that actually breathes when you’re running up and down the court. I think they said it was from KXKShop, and it looked really clean. The shorts even came in single or double-sided options, which was pretty cool.  Anyway, curious what others think  if you’ve played both AAU and school ball, which one do you prefer? Do you think one actually prepares you better, or are they just two totally different worlds?                                	reddit

8	There's a huge advantage of the first  dribble where you can setup a shot, set up a fake drive, set up a cross, hezi, in and out, scissor, anchor step, etc. There are so variations of this first move. I've been practicing it in my living room in the rainy days and makes me feel like I can pull them off even more at the pick up games. My fav is the drop + Iverson cross.  What's your opinion? overrated? overlooked, fake and lame or the goat?	reddit

10	Playing basketball here in Australia, we usually play the game to an odd number. For example  1v1/2v2 - first to 5 or 7 1s and 2s 3v3/4v4 - first to 11 1s and 2s 5v5 - first to 21 2s and 3s  All games you have to win by 2  Ive watched street ball games on YouTube in America go to 6,12 and 15	reddit
11	We present iBall, a basketball video-watching system that leverages gaze-moderated embedded visualizations to facilitate game understanding and engagement of casual fans. Video broadcasting and online video platforms make watching basketball games increasingly accessible. Yet, for new or casual fans, watching basketball videos is often confusing due to their limited basketball knowledge and the lack of accessible, on-demand information to resolve their confusion. To assist casual fans in watching basketball videos, we compared the game-watching behaviors of casual and die-hard fans in a formative study and developed iBall based on the fndings. iBall embeds visualizations into basketball videos using a computer vision pipeline, and automatically adapts the visualizations based on the game context and users' gaze, helping casual fans appreciate basketball games without being overwhelmed. We confrmed the usefulness, usability, and engagement of iBall in a study with 16 casual fans, and further collected feedback from 8 die-hard fans.	arxiv
12	This paper presents a method to assess a basketball player's performance from his/her first-person video. A key challenge lies in the fact that the evaluation metric is highly subjective and specific to a particular evaluator. We leverage the first-person camera to address this challenge. The spatiotemporal visual semantics provided by a first-person view allows us to reason about the camera wearer's actions while he/she is participating in an unscripted basketball game. Our method takes a player's first-person video and provides a player's performance measure that is specific to an evaluator's preference.   To achieve this goal, we first use a convolutional LSTM network to detect atomic basketball events from first-person videos. Our network's ability to zoom-in to the salient regions addresses the issue of a severe camera wearer's head movement in first-person videos. The detected atomic events are then passed through the Gaussian mixtures to construct a highly non-linear visual spatiotemporal basketball assessment feature. Finally, we use this feature to learn a basketball assessment model from pairs of labeled first-person basketball videos, for which a basketball expert indicates, which of the two players is better.   We demonstrate that despite not knowing the basketball evaluator's criterion, our model learns to accurately assess the players in real-world games. Furthermore, our model can also discover basketball events that contribute positively and negatively to a player's performance.	arxiv
13	The underlying physics of basketball shooting seems to be a straightforward example of the Newtonian mechanics that can easily be traced by numerical methods. However, a human basketball player does not make use of all the possible basketball trajectories. Instead, a basketball player will build up a database of successful shots and select the trajectory that has the greatest tolerance to small variations of the real world. We simulate the basketball player's shooting training as a Monte Carlo sequence to build optimal shooting strategies, such as the launch speed and angle of the basketball, and whether to take a direct shot or a bank shot, as a function of the player's court positions and height. The phase space volume that belongs to the successful launch velocities generated by Monte Carlo simulations are then used as the criterion to optimize a shooting strategy that incorporates not only mechanical, but human factors as well.	arxiv
14	Recent deep learning-based object detection approaches have led to significant progress in multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. The current MOT methods mainly focus on pedestrian or vehicle scenes, but basketball sports scenes are usually accompanied by three or more object occlusion problems with similar appearances and high-intensity complex motions, which we call complex multi-object occlusion (CMOO). Here, we propose an online and robust MOT approach, named Basketball-SORT, which focuses on the CMOO problems in basketball videos. To overcome the CMOO problem, instead of using the intersection-over-union-based (IoU-based) approach, we use the trajectories of neighboring frames based on the projected positions of the players. Our method designs the basketball game restriction (BGR) and reacquiring Long-Lost IDs (RLLI) based on the characteristics of basketball scenes, and we also solve the occlusion problem based on the player trajectories and appearance features. Experimental results show that our method achieves a Higher Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) score of 63.48$\%$ on the basketball fixed video dataset and outperforms other recent popular approaches. Overall, our approach solved the CMOO problem more effectively than recent MOT algorithms.	arxiv
15	This paper proposes a gravity balanced arm exoskeleton design for basketball shooting training. The potential energy equation of the mechanism is derived. A simulation of the arm going through the basketball shooting motion is done on the mechanism. Throughout the motion the total potential energy is constant. Thus, the proposed arm exoskeleton is indeed gravity balanced with the use of two springs.	arxiv
16	For professional basketball, finding valuable and suitable players is the key to building a winning team. To deal with such challenges, basketball managers, scouts and coaches are increasingly turning to analytics. Objective evaluation of players and teams has always been the top goal of basketball analytics. Typical statistical analytics mainly focuses on the box score and has developed various metrics. In spite of the more and more advanced methods, metrics built upon box score statistics provide limited information about how players interact with each other. Two players with similar box scores may deliver distinct team plays. Thus professional basketball scouts have to watch real games to evaluate players. Live scouting is effective, but suffers from inefficiency and subjectivity. In this paper, we go beyond the static box score and model basketball games as dynamic networks. The proposed Continuous-time Stochastic Block Model clusters the players according to their playing style and performance. The model provides cluster-specific estimates of the effectiveness of players at scoring, rebounding, stealing, etc, and also captures player interaction patterns within and between clusters. By clustering similar players together, the model can help basketball scouts to narrow down the search space. Moreover, the model is able to reveal the subtle differences in the offensive strategies of different teams. An application to NBA basketball games illustrates the performance of the model.	arxiv
17	"In this study we focus on the prediction of basketball games in the Euroleague competition using machine learning modelling. The prediction is a binary classification problem, predicting whether a match finishes 1 (home win) or 2 (away win). Data is collected from the Euroleague's official website for the seasons 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, i.e. in the new format era. Features are extracted from matches' data and off-the-shelf supervised machine learning techniques are applied. We calibrate and validate our models. We find that simple machine learning models give accuracy not greater than 67% on the test set, worse than some sophisticated benchmark models. Additionally, the importance of this study lies in the ""wisdom of the basketball crowd"" and we demonstrate how the predicting power of a collective group of basketball enthusiasts can outperform machine learning models discussed in this study. We argue why the accuracy level of this group of ""experts"" should be set as the benchmark for future studies in the prediction of (European) basketball games using machine learning."	arxiv
18	The development of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has benefited from the emergency of a variety type of game environments where new challenging problems are proposed and new algorithms can be tested safely and quickly, such as Board games, RTS, FPS, and MOBA games. However, many existing environments lack complexity and flexibility and assume the actions are synchronously executed in multi-agent settings, which become less valuable. We introduce the Fever Basketball game, a novel reinforcement learning environment where agents are trained to play basketball game. It is a complex and challenging environment that supports multiple characters, multiple positions, and both the single-agent and multi-agent player control modes. In addition, to better simulate real-world basketball games, the execution time of actions differs among players, which makes Fever Basketball a novel asynchronized environment. We evaluate commonly used multi-agent algorithms of both independent learners and joint-action learners in three game scenarios with varying difficulties, and heuristically propose two baseline methods to diminish the extra non-stationarity brought by asynchronism in Fever Basketball Benchmarks. Besides, we propose an integrated curricula training (ICT) framework to better handle Fever Basketball problems, which includes several game-rule based cascading curricula learners and a coordination curricula switcher focusing on enhancing coordination within the team. The results show that the game remains challenging and can be used as a benchmark environment for studies like long-time horizon, sparse rewards, credit assignment, and non-stationarity, etc. in multi-agent settings.	arxiv
19	We present a model that uses a single first-person image to generate an egocentric basketball motion sequence in the form of a 12D camera configuration trajectory, which encodes a player's 3D location and 3D head orientation throughout the sequence. To do this, we first introduce a future convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts an initial sequence of 12D camera configurations, aiming to capture how real players move during a one-on-one basketball game. We also introduce a goal verifier network, which is trained to verify that a given camera configuration is consistent with the final goals of real one-on-one basketball players. Next, we propose an inverse synthesis procedure to synthesize a refined sequence of 12D camera configurations that (1) sufficiently matches the initial configurations predicted by the future CNN, while (2) maximizing the output of the goal verifier network. Finally, by following the trajectory resulting from the refined camera configuration sequence, we obtain the complete 12D motion sequence.   Our model generates realistic basketball motion sequences that capture the goals of real players, outperforming standard deep learning approaches such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), and generative adversarial networks (GANs).	arxiv
20	In professional basketball, the accurate prediction of scoring opportunities based on strategic decision-making is crucial for spatial and player evaluations. However, traditional models often face challenges in accounting for the complexities of off-ball movements, which are essential for comprehensive performance evaluations. In this study, we propose two mathematical models to predict off-ball scoring opportunities in basketball, considering pass-to-score and dribble-to-score sequences: the Ball Movement for Off-ball Scoring (BMOS) and the Ball Intercept and Movement for Off-ball Scoring (BIMOS) models. The BMOS model adapts principles from the Off-Ball Scoring Opportunities (OBSO) model, originally designed for soccer, to basketball, whereas the BIMOS model also incorporates the likelihood of interception during ball movements. We evaluated these models using player tracking data from 630 NBA games in the 2015-2016 regular season, demonstrating that the BIMOS model outperforms the BMOS model in terms of team scoring prediction accuracy, while also highlighting its potential for further development. Overall, the BIMOS model provides valuable insights for tactical analysis and player evaluation in basketball.	arxiv
